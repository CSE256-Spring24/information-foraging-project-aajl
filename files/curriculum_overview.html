      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <!-- <h2>Social/Emotional Development</h2>
      <p>Individual children’s capabilities are valued and strengthened within the group throughout the
        curriculum:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building self-esteem through communication, planning, responsibility, problem-solving,
            participation, following directions, imagination and sharing within the group
          </li>

      <!-- <h2>Intellectual Development</h2> -->
      <p>Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that
        are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively
        through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
        writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into
        account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>
<p>Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the
  children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children
  learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done
  through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive reinforcement</li>
    <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction</li>
    <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities</li>

          chart, etc.</li>
        <li>Dictating, drawing, and writing stories, and creating books of the child’s own making</li>
